A new study finds long-term sleep issues and heart disease are closely linked for women.
Women who had chronic insomnia or who slept less than 5 hours a night had a higher risk of heart disease.
The sleep habits you develop in the middle of your life can have a profound impact on your future heart health, according to new research.

The studyTrusted Source, recently published in the journal CirculationTrusted Source, found that regularly sleeping fewer than seven hours a night and waking up too early or throughout the night can increase a person’s future risk of stroke, heart attack, and myocardial infarction.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women, and poor sleep is a major health issue for women, especially in midlife.

While previous studies have looked at how a poor night’s sleep is related to the development of heart disease, it’s been unclear how long-term sleep problems impact the risk of heart disease.

The new findings suggest that long-term sleep issues and heart disease are closely linked and underscore the need to improve heart disease prevention efforts in women.

“More women will die from cardiac disease than from cancer. With control of risk factors we can actually prevent heart disease in women,” Dr. Eleanor Levin, a cardiologist with Stanford Medicine, told Healthline.

           , thanks to increased efforts in prevention and treatment <br />
Overview
Malaria is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable.

The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person.

Symptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing.

Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection. 

Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse.

Malaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours.

There are 5 Plasmodium parasite species that cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species – P. falciparum and P. vivax – pose the greatest threat. P. falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent. P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. The other malaria species which can infect humans are P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi.

Symptoms
The most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.

Symptoms usually start within 10–15 days of getting bitten by an infected mosquito.

Symptoms may be mild for some people, especially for those who have had a malaria infection before. Because some malaria symptoms are not specific, getting tested early is important. 

Some types of malaria can cause severe illness and death. Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk. Severe symptoms include:

extreme tiredness and fatigue 
impaired consciousness
multiple convulsions
difficulty breathing
dark or bloody urine
jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin) 
abnormal bleeding.
People with severe symptoms should get emergency care right away. Getting treatment early for mild malaria can stop the infection from becoming severe. 

Malaria infection during pregnancy can also cause premature delivery or delivery of a baby with low birth weight.

Disease burden
According to the latest World malaria report, there were 249 million cases of malaria in 2022 compared to 244 million cases in 2021. The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 608 000 in 2022 compared to 610 000 in 2021.

The WHO African Region continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2022 the Region was home to about 94% of all malaria cases and 95% of deaths. Children under 5 years of age accounted for about 78% of all malaria deaths in the Region.

Four African countries accounted for just over half of all malaria deaths worldwide: Nigeria (26.8%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12.3%), Uganda (5.1%) and Mozambique (4.2%).
Prevention
Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and by taking medicines. Talk to a doctor about taking medicines such as chemoprophylaxis before travelling to areas where malaria is common.

Lower the risk of getting malaria by avoiding mosquito bites:  

Use mosquito nets when sleeping in places where malaria is present
Use mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin) after dusk
Use coils and vaporizers.
Wear protective clothing.
Use window screens.
Vector control
Vector control is a vital component of malaria control and elimination strategies as it is highly effective in preventing infection and reducing disease transmission. The 2 core interventions are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).

Progress in global malaria control is threatened by emerging resistance to insecticides among Anopheles mosquitoes. As described in the latest World malaria report, other threats to ITNs include insufficient access, loss of nets due to the stresses of day-to-day life outpacing replacement, and changing behaviour of mosquitoes, which appear to be biting early before people go to bed and resting outdoors, thereby evading exposure to insecticides.

Chemoprophylaxis
Travellers to malaria endemic areas should consult their doctor several weeks before departure. The medical professional will determine which chemoprophylaxis d </div>

More than 30 different bacteria, viruses and parasites are known to be transmitted through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex.
.21 May 2024 <br />Key facts
More than 1 million curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are acquired every day worldwide in people 15–49 years old, the majority of which are asymptomatic.
In 2020 there were are an estimated 374 million new infections in people 15–49 years with 1 of 4 curable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis.
An estimated 8 million adults between 15 and 49 years old were infected with syphilis in 2022.
More than 500 million people aged 15–49 years are estimated to have a genital infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV or herpes) (1).
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated with over 311 000 cervical cancer deaths each year (2).
1.1 million pregnant women were estimated to be infected with syphilis in 2022, resulting in over 390 000 adverse birth outcomes.
STIs have a direct impact on sexual and reproductive health through stigmatization, infertility, cancers and pregnancy complications and can increase the risk of HIV.
Drug resistance is a major threat to reducing the burden of STIs worldwide.</div>

It's important to keep up with how well the updated vaccines are performing. We mapped out a comparison of the COVID vaccines in the United States.
.1 week ago</div>
<div className="flex flex-1  p-2 m-2">Note: The Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine expired as of May 6, 2023, and is no longer available in the U.S. Those who did get the J&J shot are considered up-to-date when they get one updated (2023–2024 formula) COVID vaccine.

Information in this article was accurate at the time of original publication. Because information about COVID changes rapidly, we encourage you to visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and your state and local government. <br />
COVID-19 is now in its fifth year, and the subvariants of the Omicron strain continue to drive infections in the United States. The good news is that vaccines, which have been updated each year since 2022, are still expected to be effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death from COVID.

In the U.S., infants, children, and adults ages 6 months and older are eligible to be vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</div>

The Honor Roll is comprised of the top 10 pediatric hospitals in the nation out of 108 considered.

This year, Cincinnati Children’s ranked No. 1 in three specialties and placed in the top 10 for all 10 ranked specialties, making it the only health system in the 13-state Midwest region—and one of just two nationwide—to achieve this distinction.

In a significant change, Honor Roll hospitals are no longer ranked in a specific order, a shift that began with adult hospitals in 2023 and now applies to children’s hospitals.

Additionally, Pediatric & Adolescent Behavioral Health has been added to the rankings for the first time in more than 15 years. The initial list includes the top 50 hospitals, without a specific order, with Cincinnati Children’s among those recognized.

“To be named one of the best pediatric hospitals in the nation for more than 15 years is a distinct honor that each and every one of our team members should celebrate,” says Steve Davis, MD, MMM, president and CEO of Cincinnati Children’s. “Their relentless commitment to our patients and families has made Cincinnati Children’s a national leader where the sickest kids around the world can come for the best possible outcomes. I’m so proud to walk the halls of our health system and see researchers, caregivers and support staff collaborating with a ‘how might we?’ mindset to providing the highest quality care and researching the latest breakthroughs in medicine. These rankings are a reminder for us to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible so that all kids can live their healthiest lives.”

Hospitals were ranked based on key clinical data that includes measures such as patient outcomes, resources devoted directly to patient care, and patient safety. The goal of these rankings is to identify hospitals that provide the highest quality care for children with the most serious or complex medical issues.</div>
